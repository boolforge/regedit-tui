# PowerShell Integration Research

## Overview
This document summarizes research on methods for integrating C++ applications with PowerShell, focusing on how a terminal-based registry editor could be launched and used from PowerShell.

## Integration Options

### 1. Direct Execution
- **Description**: Run the C++ application directly from PowerShell
- **Pros**:
  - Simplest approach
  - No special integration required
  - Works with any PowerShell version
- **Cons**:
  - Limited interaction between PowerShell and the application
  - No access to PowerShell objects or pipeline

### 2. PowerShell Module (Binary)
- **Description**: Create a PowerShell binary module that wraps the C++ application
- **Pros**:
  - Better integration with PowerShell
  - Can expose cmdlets that follow PowerShell conventions
  - Can work with PowerShell objects
- **Cons**:
  - More complex to implement
  - Requires understanding of PowerShell module system
  - May have version compatibility issues

### 3. PowerShell Native Commands
- **Description**: Register the application as a PowerShell native command
- **Pros**:
  - Simple to implement
  - Works with PowerShell's command discovery
  - Maintains separation of concerns
- **Cons**:
  - Limited integration with PowerShell features
  - No direct access to PowerShell objects

### 4. C++/CLI Bridge
- **Description**: Use C++/CLI to create a .NET assembly that bridges between PowerShell and native C++
- **Pros**:
  - Deep integration with PowerShell
  - Full access to PowerShell objects and pipeline
  - Can implement advanced PowerShell features
- **Cons**:
  - Windows-only solution
  - Complex to implement
  - Requires understanding of both C++ and .NET

## Recommendation
For this project, the recommended approach is:

1. Start with **Direct Execution** for the initial prototype
   - Simple to implement
   - Works on all platforms where PowerShell is available
   - Allows focusing on core functionality first

2. Consider adding a simple wrapper script that:
   - Handles command-line arguments
   - Provides help and usage information
   - Ensures proper terminal settings

3. For future versions, explore creating a proper PowerShell module if there's demand for deeper integration
