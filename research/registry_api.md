# Windows Registry API Research

## Overview
This document summarizes research on C++ libraries and APIs for accessing the Windows Registry, with a focus on potential cross-platform approaches.

## Windows Registry Access Options

### 1. Windows Registry API (Native)
- **Description**: The official Windows API for registry access
- **Pros**:
  - Complete access to all registry features
  - Well-documented by Microsoft
  - Reliable and maintained
- **Cons**:
  - Windows-only
  - C-style API with complex error handling
  - Requires significant boilerplate code

### 2. WinReg (C++ Wrapper)
- **Description**: Modern C++ wrapper around the Windows Registry API by Giovanni Dicanio
- **Pros**:
  - Modern C++ interface (exceptions, RAII, etc.)
  - Type-safe operations
  - Simplifies common registry operations
  - Actively maintained
- **Cons**:
  - Windows-only (wraps the native API)
  - Additional dependency

### 3. Cross-Platform Alternatives
For true cross-platform functionality, there are no direct equivalents to the Windows Registry on other platforms. Alternative approaches include:

#### a. Abstraction Layer
- Create an abstract interface for configuration storage
- Implement using Registry on Windows and alternative storage on other platforms:
  - Linux/macOS: INI/JSON/YAML files in standard locations (e.g., ~/.config)
  - macOS: NSUserDefaults or property lists

#### b. Registry Emulation
- Implement a registry-like hierarchical storage system on non-Windows platforms
- Store data in structured files (XML, JSON) that mimic registry structure

## Cross-Platform Limitations
It's important to note that a true registry editor can only function on Windows, as other platforms don't have an equivalent registry system. For a cross-platform tool:

1. The UI and core functionality can be cross-platform
2. The registry access component would be Windows-specific
3. On non-Windows platforms, the tool could:
   - Provide a read-only view of remote Windows registries (via network)
   - Edit configuration files in a registry-like interface
   - Display a message about platform limitations

## Recommendation
For this project, the recommended approach is:

1. Use **WinReg** for Windows Registry access due to its modern C++ interface
2. Implement a platform abstraction layer that:
   - Uses WinReg on Windows
   - Provides meaningful feedback on non-Windows platforms
   - Could potentially edit configuration files on non-Windows platforms
